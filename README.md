# Hi! I'm Chiara 👋

I'm a PhD candidate in Materials Engineering specialized in **multiscale modeling** (MM/MD-DFT).  
I'm working in the [FunMat Lab](https://www.cmic.polimi.it/en/ricerca/elenco-gruppi-di-ricerca/funmat/) at Politecnico di Milano.

🔬 My research focuses on Molecular Dynamics (MM/MD) and DFT theories to explore the properties of materials.  
✨ I’m currently working on **nanomaterials** and **photoactive functional materials**.  
💻 I’m also developing codes to analyze molecular simulation data and better understand complex molecular systems.  
🌿 Outside the lab, I enjoy reading, painting, going for long walks, and exploring new places.

If you're looking for a collaborator on a **multiscale modeling** or **molecular simulation** project, feel free to reach out! 🤝
